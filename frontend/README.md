### Why These Technologies?

**Next.js** provides an excellent full-stack development experience with built-in optimizations, server-side rendering, and seamless API integration. The framework's file-based routing and automatic code splitting ensure optimal performance.

**TanStack Query** eliminates the complexity of client-side state management by providing intelligent caching, background updates, and optimistic mutations. This results in a more responsive user experience and reduced server load.

**TailwindCSS** enables rapid development with consistent design patterns while maintaining excellent performance through its purge mechanism and utility-first approach.

**Bun** significantly improves development speed with faster package installation, bundling, and test execution compared to traditional Node.js tooling.

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Bun** (recommended) or Node.js 18+
- **Backend API**: Ensure the TicketMaster backend is running and accessible

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

We recommend using **Bun** for significantly faster package installation and improved development performance:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd ticketmaster-frontend

# Install dependencies with Bun (recommended)
bun install

# Alternative: Install with npm
npm install
```

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Configure the following environment variables:

```env
# API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api

# NextAuth Configuration
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

**Security Note**: Generate a strong `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` using:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### Development

Start the development server:

```bash
# With Bun (recommended for faster performance)
bun dev

# Alternative: With npm
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Production Build

```bash
# Build for production
bun run build

# Start production server
bun run start
```

## üîó API Integration

The application integrates with a REST API backend through a centralized `apiClient`. All API calls are managed through custom hooks that provide:

- **Automatic Authentication**: Bearer token injection for authenticated requests
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Cache Management**: Intelligent cache invalidation and background updates
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI updates for better user experience

### Key API Endpoints

- `GET /projects` - Retrieve all projects with tickets
- `POST /projects` - Create new project
- `GET /tickets` - Retrieve all tickets with user information
- `POST /register` - User registration
- `POST /login` - User authentication

## üé® Component Architecture

### UI Components

The application uses a layered component architecture:

- **Base Components**: Button, Input, Select, TextArea with consistent styling
- **Card Components**: ProjectCard, TicketCard, UserCard for data display
- **Panel Components**: OpenProjectPanel, OpenTicketPanel for detailed views
- **Modal Components**: AuthModal, CreateModal for user interactions

### State Management Pattern

```typescript
// Example hook usage
const { data: projects, isLoading } = useProjects();
const createProject = useCreateProject();

// Optimistic updates with error handling
const handleCreate = async (projectData) => {
  try {
    await createProject.mutateAsync(projectData);
    toast.success("Project created successfully");
  } catch (error) {
    toast.error("Failed to create project");
  }
};
```

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations

- **Code Splitting**: Automatic route-based code splitting with Next.js
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js automatic image optimization
- **Caching Strategy**: Intelligent caching with TanStack Query (5-minute stale time)
- **Bundle Analysis**: Regular bundle size monitoring and optimization
- **Animation Performance**: Hardware-accelerated animations with Framer Motion

## üß™ Development Workflow
